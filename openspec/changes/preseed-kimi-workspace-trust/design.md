## Context

See proposal.md for motivation. The smoke run (`tmp/kimi-native-prompt-smoke/run-20260809T123938Z`) proved the modal blocks unattended TUI input; the Kimi 0.34 source checkout (`extern/orphan/kimi-code`) provided the exact suppression contract:

- The TUI shows the modal only when `getWorkspaceTrustInfo(cwd)` reports untrusted (`apps/kimi-code/src/tui/kimi-tui.ts:3151` `maybeRunWorkspaceTrustPrompt`). No CLI flag, config value, or `--auto` bypasses it; declining exits the program.
- Trust state is presence-only: a JSON document at `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/workspace-trust/<encodeWorkDirKey(cwd)>` (`packages/agent-core-v2/src/workspace/workspaceTrust/workspaceTrustService.ts:101` trusts when the document exists; content is not validated on read).
- `encodeWorkDirKey` (`packages/agent-core-v2/src/_base/utils/workdir-slug.ts:29`): normalize the path (backslashes to slashes, strip trailing slashes), take the basename, slugify (lowercase, non-`[a-z0-9._-]` runs → `-`, strip leading/trailing `-`, truncate to 40 chars, re-strip), append `_<sha256(normalized path)[:12]>`. Verified: a Python recomputation reproduced the live record `wd_run-20260809t123938z_8f56092721df` byte-for-byte.
- Canonical record bytes: `{"root": "<cwd>", "trustedAt": <epoch milliseconds>}` (compact JSON, no trailing newline — `JsonAtomicDocumentStore` encodes via plain `JSON.stringify`).
- Trust gates only project-level MCP config (`.mcp.json`, `.kimi-code/mcp.json`); headless `-p` never shows the modal but follows the same trusted/untrusted config split.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Unattended managed Kimi launches (headless and TUI, fresh and relaunch) never surface the trust modal and always follow the trusted config path.
- The pre-seed shares the `SYSTEM.md` lifecycle: one writer, two enforcement points (brain construction, provider start), provenance recorded.
- `as_is` launches and non-Kimi tools are untouched.

**Non-Goals:**

- Changing Kimi's trust semantics or upstream feature requests.
- Pre-trusting anything beyond the launch working directory (no recursive or parent-dir trust).
- Migrating existing stopped brains; the next provider start re-asserts the record anyway.
- Project MCP server management; trust only un-gates Kimi's native loading decision.

## Decisions

### 1. Implement `encodeWorkDirKey` parity in Python with a pinned test vector

Add a small helper (sibling to `kimi_system_prompt.py`) that reproduces `encodeWorkDirKey` exactly, including the slug truncation edge cases. Pin the verified live vector (`/data/.../run-20260809T123938Z` → `wd_run-20260809t123938z_8f56092721df`) plus synthetic edge cases (uppercase, spaces, trailing slash, long names, dot names) in unit tests.

Alternative considered: shell out to `kimi` or node to compute the key. Rejected — the algorithm is ten lines and a runtime dependency on the provider for home construction is circular.

### 2. One writer, gated on Kimi + unattended, called from both enforcement points

`ensure_kimi_workspace_trust(home_path, workdir)` writes the canonical record by atomic replacement (same pattern as `ensure_kimi_system_prompt`), returns typed provenance (state `projected`/`unchanged`, path, workspace key), and is a no-op byte-wise when the record already matches. Brain construction calls it after `SYSTEM.md` projection; provider-start planning calls it with the launch plan's actual working directory before process start, repairing drift and covering relaunch-into-different-workdir. Both call sites are gated on the Kimi tool lane and `operator_prompt_mode == unattended`.

Alternative considered: build-time only. Rejected — the relaunch workdir can differ from the build workdir, and provider start is where the launch plan knows the real workdir.

### 3. Provenance extends the existing native-prompt payload, no schema change

Add a `workspace_trust` sub-object beside `native_system_prompt` in the same metadata/provenance payloads (path, key, state). Session-manifest and launch-plan schemas carry these as metadata maps, so no schema version bump.

### 4. No trust removal on stop or rebuild

The record is harmless provider state inside a Houmao-owned home; cleanup follows the home lifecycle (clean rebuild removes the whole home). Houmao never writes "untrust" — Kimi defines untrust as deletion, and deletion only matters if the operator uses the home manually, which is unsupported.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [A later Kimi release changes the key algorithm or record shape] → The pinned live test vector fails loudly on requalification; the strategy declares `>=0.34.0` source evidence, same posture as the `SYSTEM.md` contract.
- [Pre-trusting weakens Kimi's MCP injection guard] → The workdir is operator-chosen at launch and the home is Houmao-owned; unattended mode already asserts the operator's intent to run without confirmations. `as_is` keeps the native guard.
- [Kimi validates record content in a future release] → We write the full canonical shape (`root`, `trustedAt` epoch ms), not a minimal stub, so content validation would still pass.

## Migration Plan

1. Land the helper, both call sites, provenance, and unit tests together.
2. Re-run the smoke harness TUI leg: it passes when `trust_dialog_accepted` is `false` (no modal mounted) — update the script to fail if the modal appears rather than accepting it.
3. No operator migration: existing stopped brains self-heal on next provider start.

Rollback is release-level: remove the call sites; homes with stray trust records are unaffected.

## Open Questions

None. The suppression contract is verified against the 0.34.0 source and a live record.
